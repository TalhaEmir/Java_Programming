Week13 review:


Inheritance
Method Overriding

Number class is a Super class
Wrapper classes:
	Integer extends Number
	Double extends Number

access modifiers

    keywords used to define the scope or visibility (where you can use/access the variables, methods, etc]

    [Most Visible] public  -> protected  -> default -> private [Least Visible]

    public: accessible everywhere in the project

    protected: accessible by the classes within the same packages and the sub classes in any package
        (second part is about inheritance, so we will come back to this)

    default: accessible within the same package
        -> default is used when no other access modifier is defined

    private: accessible only in the same class

What is inherited from super class to sub class.

Depends on Access modifiers of method or variable:
	public -> all inherited anywhere in the project
	protected -> all inherited anywhere in the project
	default -> only inherited when sub class and super class are in same package
	private -> not inherited. Accessing only in same class

Screenshot: Mac: Command + control + Shift + 4
			Windows:


Your IntelliJ project:
	- added classes with code.
	- enabled GIT
	- committed our code to local repository
	- add gitignore
	- Github:
		1) login to GitHub > Goto repositories > create new repository
		https://github.com/Murodil-Cydeo/java-live-review.git
	- Add GitHub repository URL as our project remote
	- Git push

Constructors in Inheritance
    constructor is not inherited, but the child class constructor must always call the parent class constructor
        -> using super() the parent constructor is called

        -> the default constructor always called super() in the first line

Method Overriding

	change the implementation(code) of a method that is inherited from a super class
		-> another way to phrase it: after inheriting a method we can change how it works

	use of overriding: create method implementation that is more specific for the sub class

	@Override
		annotation that helps make sure you override the method correctly
		using the annotation is optional, but recommended to use

Method Overriding rules

	method needs to be inherits
	method signature should be the same
		method signature: name + parameters
	access modifier should be the same or more visible

	return type should be same
		*** or covariant: sub class of that return type (we can talk about later)

Inheritance questions

IQ: Can you have more than one direct parent?
    NO, java does not allow multi-inheritance ( multiple parents at the same time )

IQ: What is the difference between this and super

    this: reference to the instance of the current class
        -> used to differentiate local variables and instance variables
        -> used to access the instance members of the current class

    super: reference to the instance of the parent class
        -> used to access the instance members in the parent class

IQ: What is the difference between this() and super()

    this(): call a constructor in the same class
        -> Based on the argument given you could call any constructor

    super(): call the constructor from the parent class
        -> default constructor always uses super() on the first line
            -> In order to make an object of the child class we have to call the parent class constructor

IQ: What is the difference between method overloading and overriding

    overloading: have a method with the same name, different parameters
        -> happens in the same class

    overriding: changing the implementation of a method that came from the super class
        -> happens between the super and sub class

IQ: How can you override static methods?
	static methods cannot be overridden, it is possible to declare a method with the same name in the sub class, but this is called method hiding, not overriding.

	------------------------------------------------------------------------

access modifiers with inheritance

	private: cannot be inherited

	default: can only be inherited within the same package

	protected: can inherit the fields to the subclass no matter if its in the same package or not

	public: can inherit anywhere in the project

with inheritance: public and protected are the same
without inheritance: default and protected are the same

Types of inheritance

	Single inheritance: one class to another class

		class Planet{
		}

		class Mars extends Planet{
		}

	Multi level: one class is the direct parent of one class and acts like the grandparent of another

		class Animal {
		}

		class Dog extends Animal{
		}

		class Husky extends Dog {
		}

	Hierarchical: the same class is the direct parent of many sub classes. Those sub classes being like siblings

		class Book {
		}

		class AudioBook extends Book {
		}

		class EBook extends Book {
		}

		class TextBook extends Book{
		}

__________________________________________________________________
these were all there even if we didn't see them:

Book.java

import java.lang.*;
public class Book extends Object{
    public Book(){
        super();
    }
}
